libtmdb
=======

libtmdb is a simple C wrapper / library for the The Movie DB
(TMDb) API, this library depends on libcurl for network calls.

Please be aware that it is also still on early development stage,
any contribution is welcome.

You can find simliar wrappers / libraries for other languages at
<https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/wrappers-libraries>

1) Documentation
----------------

Plenty of examples from the examples/ folder.

In case for the TMDb API itself, you can find the documentation
at <https://developers.themoviedb.org/3>

2) Parsing JSON
---------------

Every function that does network calls, such as tmdb_get*,
tmdb_post*, and tmdb_delete* returns TMDbBuffer (membuffer).

In order to use the response, access the struct member named
data. In order to parse JSON itself, you have to utilize JSON
parsing libraries like json-c, jsmn, etc. Or take a look here for
a complete list <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>
