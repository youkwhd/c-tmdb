c-tmdb
======

c-tmdb is  a simple C wrapper  /   library  for the The  Movie DB
(TMDb) API. This library depends on libcurl, please be aware that
it   is also  still   on development phase, any   contribution is
welcome.

You can  find simliar wrappers / libraries for other languages at
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/wrappers-libraries

1) API documentation
--------------------

The API of this library is quite well documented in the comments,
you  can  refer to  the  file   c-tmdb.h,  or  straight  into the
examples/ folder.

In case  for the TMDb API  itself, you can find the documentation
at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

2) Parsing JSON
---------------

Every tmdb_get* function will return JSON in char* type, in order
to  use  the JSON  itself,  you   have  to  utilize  JSON parsing
libraries  like  json-c, jsmn,  etc.  Or  take a look  here for a
complete list https://www.json.org/json-en.html
